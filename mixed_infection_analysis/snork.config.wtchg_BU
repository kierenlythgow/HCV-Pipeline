# - Blank lines are permitted.                                                 #
# - Lines starting with '#' are comments.                                      #
# - Leading & trailing spaces around the option names, or values are stripped. #
# - Options with the same name can appear in more than 1 block.                #
# - The value of the option is the last one in the file that applies.          #
# - The leading spaces on every line make it easier to comment out lines.      #
# - Variable names used more than once refer to the same information.          #
# - {variable} refers to the value of the variable.                            #
# - Circulat definitions for values are not permitted.                         #
# - Options set to DISABLED will not be used.                                  #
